Study Buddies - Kayley, Thea, Vivi

Currently, our app supports the following functionalities: Sign in and out, sign up, view locations on a map and click on a building to see all active study groups occuring in that building, searching for study groups, 
and seeing more information about a study group.

Note: Our app allows for a form for users to start a study group but the actual sending of data to firebase is not working yet. Users also cannot join a study group. That will be implemented after we are able to start a study group 
and put the information in firebase.

Changes to our revised design include: making the map view be a map view of the campus with pinned locations. Clicking on a pin will open a page displaying all active study groups in that location. 

Workplan:
From December 11-15, we will focus on getting the study group information into firebase. After that we will work on letting users join a study group. From December 15-20, we will work on showing study groups on a profile page.
